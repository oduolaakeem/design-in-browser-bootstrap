# Design In The Browser Bootstrap, Patternlab edition!

**Please don't make any further changes to this project, as wagtail-kit is going to be the base for our tooling, pattern library and components from now on. Readme retained below for reference.**

This project provides a starting point for prototypes, with tooling and an opinion on CSS and JS structure to allow for rapid development utilising Patternlab ensuring all work is as transferable and as maintainable as possible.

## What's required

It is assumed the developers computer is running OSX or Linux. Depending on your setup you may already have the below installed;

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) (version 4.x.x)
* [PHP](http://www.php.net/) (version 5.5+)
* Optional: [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

## What's included

* [Patternlab-PHP](https://github.com/pattern-lab/edition-php-twig-standard): Currently the most complete and stable version of patternlab, and supports [twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/).
* [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) CSS with [auto-prefixing](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).
* [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io) for autoreloading.
* [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io) for ES2015 support with module loading.
* Consideration for images, currently copying the directory only. We encourage using SVG for icons and pre-optimised photograph assets.
* An automated way to upload your site to a staging server using [dploy](https://github.com/LeanMeanFightingMachine/dploy).
* [Build commands](#build-scripts) for generating testable or deployable assets only

## Installation

To start a prototype using this bootstrap;

* **Get the files:** Clone this repository to a new directory, for example;
`git clone https://github.com/torchbox/design-in-browser-bootstrap.git new-project`.
* **Name the project:** Open `package.json` and replace the `name` with your project name [following npm guidelines](http://browsenpm.org/package.json#name).
* **Setup git**: Run `npm run git:init` in the root of your new project to remove existing git links with this repository and create a fresh project with the directory as is committed.
* **Install dependencies** Run `yarn install` to run the install process. `npm install` will work too, see [section about yarn below](#using-yarn).


## Developing with it

* To start the development environment `npm run lab` - to stop this process press `ctrl + c`.
* This will start Browsersync and open your default browser after the startup process is complete. You can change this configuation by modifying the `browsersync.config.js` file, documented here https://www.browsersync.io/docs/options.
* Source files for developing your project are in `site` and the distribution folder for the compiled assets is `dist`. Any changes made to files in the `dist` directory will be overwritten.

### Using yarn

* Yarn is the recommended way to install and upgrade node modules. It's like npm but [handles dependencies better](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/40057469/what-is-the-difference-between-yarn-lock-and-npm-shrinkwrap#answer-40057535).
* Install yarn itself: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install
* Install all packages from `package.json`: `yarn install`
* Add new packages with yarn: `yarn add --dev package_name` (this will add it to `package.json` and `yarn.lock` too)
* Upgrade packages: `yarn upgrade-interactive`
* You can use `yarn` instead of `npm run` to run tooling scripts, for example `yarn lab` instead of `npm run lab`.


## Deploying it

### Deploy script

You can take advantage of the nodejs package [dploy](https://github.com/LeanMeanFightingMachine/dploy) to upload the `/dist` directory. To do so you will need to;

 * Make a copy of `example.dploy.yaml` and name it `dploy.yaml`.
 * Modify the `host` `user` and `path.remote` variables.
 * Run `npm run deploy` to start the deployment process.

### Build scripts

To only build assets for either development or production you can use

 * `npm run build` To build development assets
 * `npm run build:prod` To build assets with minification and vendor prefixes

### Debug script

To test production, minified and vendor prefixed assets you can use

 * `npm run debug` To develop with a simple http server, no browsersync and production assets


## Troubleshooting

### Installation
If you see the following error you can resolve node permissions using these steps: https://github.com/npm/npm/wiki/Troubleshooting#permission-error

```
npm WARN package.json globalwitness@0.0.1 No repository field.
npm ERR! Error: EACCES, mkdir '/Users/Dave/.npm/depd/1.0.0'
npm ERR!  { [Error: EACCES, mkdir '/Users/Dave/.npm/depd/1.0.0']
npm ERR!   errno: 3,
npm ERR!   code: 'EACCES',
npm ERR!   path: '/Users/Dave/.npm/depd/1.0.0',
npm ERR!   parent: 'connect' }
npm ERR!
npm ERR! Please try running this command again as root/Administrator.

```

## Technical Debt

 - 30 minute timeout from patternlab is hardcoded and within the vendor directory, a value has been modified in /patternlab/vendor/pattern-lab/core/src/PatternLab/Console/Commands/WatchCommand.php
 - Missing classes have been added to improve the rendering of titles on the file /patternlab/vendor/pattern-lab/styleguidekit-twig-default/views/partials/patternSectionSubtype.twig
